Welcome to Flatiron School's Phase 2 Project repository, where we delve into the fascinating realm of customer churn data analysis. Our focus? Analyzing customer churn data from SyriaTel telecommunication company
## Project Overview
Within this project, our primary objective revolved around analyzing the data from SyriaTel. The ultimate aim was to construct a robust predictive classification model. We embarked on this endeavor by carefully evaluating the available data and establishing a baseline model using Logistic Regression. Subsequently, we explored various classification techniques such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na√Øve Bayes, and Random Forest, employing different hyperparameter tunings in each case. Finally, we arrived at our conclusive predictive model, XGBoost, which was fine-tuned using a pipeline and grid search approach, encompassing a wide range of hyperparameter configurations.
## Business problem and Stakeholder Understanding.
As a data scientist team dedicated to the telecom industry, our collective mission revolves around assisting a telecom company in boosting its revenue by tackling customer churn. Our primary objective is to leverage the power of predictive modeling to identify and target customers who are most likely to churn. By delving into the intricacies of churn factors, our aim is to provide valuable insights to the business, enabling them to effectively address customer attrition, improve customer retention rates, and ultimately drive revenue growth.
# DATA
Data was gathered from Kaggle.com dataset. The telecom dataset contains information on 3333 customers and 19 features.
# EDA
# Customers Service calls

We find out:
Telecom customers who frequently make service calls tend to churn more especially after 4 service calls. This can be a couple of factors customers who experience persistent service issues or technical problems may become frustrated with the telecom provider's inability to resolve their concerns effectively. Customers who frequently require assistance may feel that company customer support is inadequate to solve problems thus customers will lose trust and satisfaction.
We recommend:   
Customers who engage in more than four service calls can be rewarded with incentives, fostering a positive customer experience. Additionally capturing and preserving data and detailed records of their complaints and the reason for their calls will enable data science team to comprehensively analyse.
# Customers with international plan

There are 323 customers with international plan from which 42% churn
There are 3010 customers without international plan from which 11% churn
People with international plan churn more than people without international plan

We find out:
There can be several reasons why cutomers with international plan may churn more compared to those without international plan. International plans comes with additional charges and extra cost can make the bill higher for customers with international plans. Some customers may find altenative options for international communication that are more cost effective such as WhatsApp.
We recommend:
Review cost of international plan and calls. Avoid unexpected charges to avoid dissatisfaction. To find way to avoid switching internet communication apps.

# Churn by states.

We find out:
Examining customer churn rate from telecom by each state in the USA requires a comprehensive analysis of different factors that may influence customer behavior. We need the factor of competition. States with a high number of telecom providers who offer the same services will be competitive. As customers have more options to choose. So, telecom must improve services to lower churn rate. Factor of network quality: the quality of network coverage can influence customer satisfaction and churn rate. States with widespread network infrastructure are likely to have lower churn rates. Population Mobility: States with a significant number of tourists may experience higher churn rates. Socioeconomic factors: income level and population density can also influence churn rate.
We recommend:
In the future our data science team would recommend providing us data about following factors to analyze feature importance. Also, we will combine available information for socioeconomics and population mobility to analyze each state separately.
## Model
## XGBoost.

Our final model was XGBoost classifier which was able to predict customer churn with 74% recall.
Model accuracy was 93% and Precision was 88%.
Model predicted 22 times customers will be left, actually they stayed company need to offer discount for this group.

Model predicted 32 times customers will not be left, actually they left company may need to offer free month rate to keep this group, because to acquire new customers is more expensive than keeping old.

Model predicted 93 times customers will left and actually they left. We need to offer some percentage discount for this group in advance.

Model predicted 687 times customers will not churn and they actually did not churn. The company nothing have to offer this group.
## Feature Importances:

By examining the feature importances we can determine which feature contributes the most to the predictive power of model. The higher the importance score the more influential the feature is in determining the outcome of the classification task.
